The raw sequencing data underwent comprehensive processing to generate dashboard-ready visualizations through a systematic Python-based pipeline designed for scalability and reproducibility with large metagenomic datasets. The data processing pipeline was implemented using **Python 3.9** with a set of libraries for large-scale data analysis and processing, including **pandas 2.2.3** and **numpy 2.2.1**. The pipeline integrates multiple data sources, including sample metadata, abundance tables from species identification, read statistics from quality control reports, and geographic information for regional mapping. The system utilizes Python's concurrent tools to speed up the process to achieve optimal performance. Comprehensive data validation is implemented throughout the workflow, including sample ID consistency checks across datasets, detection of incomplete records, and automated error reporting for failed processing attempts. The final output consists of dashboard-optimized CSV files with standardized formatting, filtered common sample sets, and removed human sequences to focus on environmental microbial diversity for public health analysis. Result files were uploaded to the Power BI used for the dashboard implementation.
