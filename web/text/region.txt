The Region page enables users to examine sample collections from a specific area. A filter for collection dates updates all visualizations, including the total counts of samples, species, and pathogens highlighted in red. Charts based on seasonal and location data showcase distribution trends, while a ranked bar chart emphasizes the top ten identified species, with pathogens also marked in red. Users can access individual samples and engage with a comprehensive metagenomic table that presents taxonomic levels from kingdom to species, along with a selector for each level. The samples and species offer "drill through" navigation to detailed description pages.
