The Species page aggregates sample metadata from all collected samples, including the number of samples, location, and season. Users can filter samples based on collection date and the absolute abundance of the specified species. The map of US regions and the accompanying table highlight the number of samples in which the selected species was identified, according to the chosen abundance filters and collection dates.
