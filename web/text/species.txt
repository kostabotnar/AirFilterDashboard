The Species page aggregates sample metadata from all collected samples for the specific species, including the number of samples, location, and season [1]. Users can filter samples based on collection date [2] and the absolute abundance of the specified species [3]. The map of US regions and the accompanying table highlight the number of samples [4] in which the selected species was identified, according to the chosen abundance filters and collection dates.
