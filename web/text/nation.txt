The nation view page presents sample collection patterns throughout the United States. Users can filter data by collection date [1] and examine trends via various visualizations, such as a line chart for daily sample counts [2], a donut chart illustrating seasonal distribution [3], and a bar chart for location comparisons [4]. A map of the US highlights sample distribution across the 10 FEMA regions, along with a summary table [5] providing detailed regional counts. Both the map and the table support right-click "drill-through" navigation to the region page.
