  "nationwide": "The nation view page presents sample collection patterns throughout the United States. Users can filter data by collection date and examine trends via various visualizations, such as a line chart for daily sample counts, a donut chart illustrating seasonal distribution, and a bar chart for location comparisons. A map of the US highlights sample distribution across the 10 FEMA regions, along with a summary table providing detailed regional counts. Both the map and the table support right-click \"drill-through\" navigation to the region page.",

  "navigation": "The drill-through feature allows users to transition from a general overview to a detailed description of a specific data element. By right-clicking on a data point (e.g., a region on a map, a row in a table), users can select the \"Drill through\" option in the menu and then choose the page they wish to visit. This action will direct them to the page displaying the information for the chosen data point. To return to the previous page, click the back button located in the upper left corner of the dashboard.\nNavigating the dashboard with the left-right controllers at the bottom of the page is not advisable.

  "slicing-values-selection": "Each dashboard element – whether a chart, map, or table – allows users to filter data by clicking on a specific value. For instance, clicking on a particular season in the donut chart updates the entire page to show only data for that season and its proportion regarding the total collection. Users can select multiple values by holding the CTRL key and clicking on different data points across dashboard elements. The image illustrates a data slice for samples collected in the Outdoor location in Spring and Fall. To clear all filters, simply click on an empty space on the dashboard.",
  "slicing-collection-date": "The collection date slicer allows you to set a global date range for all dashboard pages, controlling when samples are collected. The first selector adjusts the start date, and the second sets the end date. These selectors appear on three pages: Nationwide view, Region view, and Species view. Changing the date window on one page will update it across all pages. To revert to the default date range, click the “Reset” button next to the slicer, which resets the date boundaries to their minimum and maximum values.",
  "slicing-taxonomy-levels": "Each taxonomy information table for the identified species includes specific selectors for each taxonomy level and the pathogen flag. These selectors function as drop-down lists that allow multiple selections, which can be made by holding the CTRL button. Each also incorporates a search box to filter options by typing a name. The pathogen selector filters the dataset based on the species' pathogen status. To clear a selection, choose the “Select All\" option. Selecting a filter automatically updates the taxonomy table and triggers data filtering across the entire page."
