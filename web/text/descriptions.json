  "nationwide": "The nation view page presents sample collection patterns throughout the United States. Users can filter data by collection date and examine trends via various visualizations, such as a line chart for daily sample counts, a donut chart illustrating seasonal distribution, and a bar chart for location comparisons. A map of the US highlights sample distribution across the 10 FEMA regions, along with a summary table providing detailed regional counts. Both the map and the table support right-click \"drill-through\" navigation to the region page.",
